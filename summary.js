//pros and coms of each data structure
//there are 3 sources of data
// 1 the data can be written from the program itself
// from the user interface or data written in DOM
//from external sources... like a we API
//an API stands for application programming interface
// no matter were the data is coming from.. we still need to store it
// and we store data im data structures
// there are four main data structures
// if we need a single set of values .. we can use  an array or a set
// if we need key value pairs on the other hand, we can use an object or a map
//ARRAYS
// in modern javascript applictaions.. the modern form nof get data is through an Api
// use when you nedd ordered list of values (might contain duplicates)
// use when you need to manipulate data
//SETS
// use when you need to work with unique values
// use when high - =erformance is really important
// use to remove duplicates from arrays
//OBJECTS
// More "traditional" key/value store ("abused" objects)
// easier to write and access values with and []
// use of you need functions as values
// use when working with  JSON (can convert to map)
//MAPS
//better perforamce
//keys can have any data type
// easy to iterate
// easy to compute size
// use when you simply need ro map key to values
// use when you need keys that are not strings
